\section{Abstract}
This report documents the design and implementation of \Gls{depot}, a \gls{telemetry} storage and visualisation system for the NTNU \acrshort{hypso} \Gls{smallsat} using the Open Mission Control Technologies (Open MCT) data visualisation framework. The system is based on an \Gls{express} web server running on \Gls{node}, which requests and stores telemetry from a telemetry database operated by \Gls{nanoavionics}. The system was initially designed to decode Flight Computer and Electronic Power Supply module telemetry, but is expandable to accept other telemetry sources with minimal modifications to the Open MCT interface. It can store and subsequently display telemetry from these sources in near real-time in Open MCT. The stored telemetry data may also be exported or requested outside Open MCT by connecting to the \Gls{express}-based telemetry web server using \acrshort{http} for historical telemetry data, or with \Gls{ws} for subscribing to near real-time telemetry data updates.

The latest version of the documentation and source code for the system is available at \url{https://github.com/NTNU-SmallSat-Lab/mct-depot}.
