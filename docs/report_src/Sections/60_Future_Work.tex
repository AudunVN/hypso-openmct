  \item Set up and document production server
  \item Further development of NanoAvionics server connection
  \item Add remaining NanoAvionics telemetry definitions
  \item Add more data sources
  \item Improve handling of NanoAvionics array telemetry values
  \item Improve test coverage
  \item Code refactoring and cleanup
  \item Add server-side data storage for Open MCT views and data changes
  \item Add processing, storage and display of calculated/derived telemetry values
\end{itemize}
